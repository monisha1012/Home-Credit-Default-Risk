# Home-Credit-Default-Risk

The main aim of this project is to create a summary notebook based on the best of kernel files and try to extend based on our understanding and research and improve our leaderboard rank. The objective of this competition is to use historical loan application data to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan. This is a standard supervised classification task.

We haven't uploaded data files to this notebook, since the files are large around 2GB Git is throwing some issues. Dataset can be found from the above link
